									<h3 class="major">Ho-Oh the healing pokemon</h3>
									<p>Ho-Oh, like its lesser counterpart Pokemon, Moltres, is based on the legendary Phoenix, a creature of Greek Mythology also known as the Firebird. Many cultures worldwide hold the Phoenix as a symbol of Longevity, Resurrection, and Reincarnation. Thus, Ho-Oh epitomizes this belief, as it was reborn rising from its own ashes. It also used its vast powers to give new life to the first Raikou, Entei, and Suicune, after they perished in Ecruteak City's Burned Tower. It is believed that through its unique abilities, this mighty Pokémon created the Legendary Beasts of the Johto Region out of a Jolteon, a Flareon, and Vaporeon respectively. However, it is unknown whether this is actually true. It is said that wherever a Ho-Oh flies, a beautiful rainbow appears behind it.Ho-oh, a Legendary Bird Pokémon based on the Phoenix Bird, is a vastly powerful Fire-and-Flying type Pokémon. It can revive any Pokémon, is incredibly fast, and has the devastating Fire-Type attack, "Sacred Fire".It also holds an item called Sacred Ash, which is like a Pokémon Center, only portable. This Held Item is unique in that it revives all fainted Pokémon in your party to full HP/full PP. If caught at Navel Rock in Emerald/FireRed/LeafGreen the Sacred Ash is buried under the spot that Ho-Oh occupies. After Ho-Oh is caught or defeated, press the A button and you will obtain the Hold Item Sacred Ash.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Mew</h3>
									<p>Mew is a small, cat-like Pokémon with small, pointed ears, blue eyes, a long, thin tail, and large feet with three toes. It is covered with a layer of fine, pink hair, only visible with the aid of a microscope. It has short arms with three fingers on each paw, and has small, orange, paw pads on the undersides of its feet.It is said that Mew's DNA possesses the genetic composition of all existing Pokémon species, thus allowing it to use all known Pokémon moves. Its possession of every Pokémon's DNA also allows it to devolve Pokémon, as show in the TCG through its moves Devolution Beam and Devo Crush.</p>
